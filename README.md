# Easy Vagrant / EV
Easy Vagrant - A simple tool to create WordPress sites using VVV

Easy Vagrant is a simple tool that makes creating sites with VVV very easy. It's inspired by bradp's VV (Varying Vagrants). Unfotunately, VV was not maintained as VVV progressed and VV itself no longer adheres to the VVV "way" of creating sites. EV is a continuation of those same efforts to make VVV easy for the new VVV 2.0. That means that it's very simple to use the new features of VVV without having to use work arounds.

Another goal of EV is to make porting from using VV extremely easy. This is something we're currently working on but will accomplish in the next month.

** Easy Vagrant is in beta at the moment and is still under construction. Plans are to have it fully usable and stable by the end January 2018. **
